<h3>Personal Profile</h3>

<p>I’m currently a Research Fellow in the Department of Computing, University of Surrey. I work in collaboration with staff at Kew Gardens and several other universities. My work includes developing software to locate and characterize leaves in digital images of dried specimens stored in the Herbarium of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. This has involved researching and developing a range of methods, focussing on shape analysis and automated character extraction.

<p>I worked for three years as a Research Fellow in the UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, working with visual neuroscientist Dr Beau Lotto. I investigated various aspects of human and insect vision, such as the appearance of optical illusions and the perception of lightness, colour, depth and so on. I used statistical and machine learning tools, such as artificial neural networks, to produce “virtual animals” that learned to see simple images within a synthetic ecology, and then analysed their behaviour. This helped us to better understand the evolution and function of natural vision systems and contributed to visual neuroscience more generally.

<p>Until 2006, I was a Senior Research Fellow in the Computer Science department at University College, London, where I developed an information extraction tool (called "BioRAT") to help life
sciences researchers to find and analyse relevant publications. This work was
in collaboration with a number of academic and commercial organisations.</p>

<p>My PhD focussed on applying machine
learning techniques to industrial data mining problems. I am interested in the
transfer of knowledge between industry and academia, and drawing on the
different strengths of each. I have several years of professional computing
experience, when I acquired many technical and non-technical skills, including
software analysis and design, programming in several languages, liaison with
clients and supervision of junior colleagues. I returned to university to
undertake an&nbsp;MSc degree and then a&nbsp;PhD, in order to explore and
expand my interests in machine learning, and in the application of novel
techniques to industrial problems.</p>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p ><i>1998-2002</i><b> PhD Computer Science at University College, London</b>. My thesis is "Intelligent Analysis of Small Data Sets for Food Design", and concerns the development and
evaluation of machine learning methods, motivated by product design work within
the food industry. The aim is to model consumer preferences of food products,
by learning relationships from very small data sets. Areas researched include
feature selection, cluster analysis, outlier detection, regression, and
Bayesian belief networks.</p>

<p>Unilever plc sponsored this work, and provided data and advice
throughout. I spent 6 months at one of their research centres (Colworth House),
which allowed me to disseminate current academic thinking within Unilever and
learn more about their approaches to data analysis.</p>

<p>The research was undertaken within
the Postgraduate Training Partnership (PTP) established between Sira Ltd and
University College London. PTPs are a joint initiative of the DTI and EPSRC. As
a PTP Associate, I attended several training courses, including management,
marketing, finance and presentation skills. I also attended a residential
"business game" training session jointly organised by the DTI and EPSRC.</p>

<p ><i>1997-1998</i> <b>MSc Computational
Intelligence (with Distinction) at Plymouth University</b>. This included study
of adaptive intelligent systems such as genetic algorithms and neural networks,
and their application to engineering, business and financial systems. My thesis
reported an investigation into using Genetic Programming as a tool for
high-dimensional symbolic regression and system identification. This work was
in collaboration with Unilever plc, and involved modelling chemical data sets.
The degree also included modules in project management and communication
skills.</p>

<p ><i>1991-1994</i> <b>BSc (Hons.) Cognitive
Science, Class 2 (ii)</b> from Exeter University. This included study of
artificial intelligence, neural networks, perception, cognition and
linguistics, along with more general computer science and psychology modules.</p>

<p> <i>July 2006-present</i> <b>Research fellow, Institute of Ophthalmology, UCL. </b>I work in collaboration with Dr
Beau Lotto, where I develop neural network applications in Matlab and training
these networks to make predictions from ambiguous stimuli. This is part of a
larger research project looking at visual perception, and relating this to
historical experience.</p>

<p> <i>February 2004 - February 2006</i> <b>Part-time tutor /
teaching assistant for the Open and Distance Learning Unit of Queen Mary,
University of London</b>. I taught several undergraduate Computer Science
modules to distance learning students, on an ad hoc basis. This involved online
teaching and discussion with students from a wide variety of backgrounds, along
with coursework and exam preparation and marking.</p>

<p>November 2001 - July 2006</i><b> Senior
Research Fellow at University College, London, Department of Computer Science.</b>
 From 2001-2004, I worked with a major pharmaceutical company to
develop software to aid their drug-development programs. This collaboration later
continued and broadened to include a second pharmaceutical company and several
academic biomedical research groups. The software (“BioRAT”) is designed to
locate documents on the internet, and to extract useful information from them
to build a database. The software is available from
<a href="http://bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/biorat">bioinf.cs.ucl.ac.uk/biorat</a>, along with further documentation.</p>

<p>My work also involved undergraduate and Master’s level project supervision, and some classroom-based teaching support work. </p>

<p>March 2002-July 2003</i><b> Part-time research associate, UCL Institute of Ophthalmology.</b> I carried out some research work in collaboration with Dr Beau Lotto, which  involved developing neural network applications in Matlab and training these networks to make predictions from ambiguous stimuli. This was part of a larger research project
looking at the perception of brightness, and relating this to historical experience.</p>

<p><i>April -September 1999</i><b> Part-time research consultant, Computer Science, UCL. </b>During the first year of my PhD, I was employed as a research
consultant at UCL as part of the AIMEDIA project in 1999. This ESPRIT-funded
project bought together European retailers and academics, along with marketing
and software companies. The project aim was to develop systems to produce
targeted advertising for home shoppers. My work included the evaluation of
possible data mining tools and an initial set of data mining studies, and
concluded with several co-authored reports and presentations to the partners.</p>

<p> <i>February 1995-September 1997 </i><b>Analyst Programmer</b>
<b>at Fraser Williams plc</b>, a London software house, where I was involved in
designing and programming two large-scale database systems. These were both
bespoke systems, and involved long-term projects for clients drawn from both
the Government and private sectors. Besides programming, my responsibilities
included visiting these clients on-site to discuss and clarify their needs, and
occasionally to provide training courses. I also took responsibility for
supervising more junior programmers and providing on-the-job training. I tested
software, and wrote both user and technical documentation.</p>

<h3>Other Skills and Competencies</h3>

<p><b>Computing Skills</b></p>

<p>I have professional experience of several major programming
languages and operating systems, including Matlab, Java, C++, Visual Basic,
SQL, Prolog and PRO-IV, under Windows and UNIX systems.</p>

<p>
<b>Music</b>: I enjoy creating experimental music and
sound recordings, including some collaborative work. I also play the clarinet.
<br>
<b>Languages</b>: Rudimentary knowledge of Japanese (currently studying) and French (including taking evening classes, 1999-2000).
<br>
Duke of Edinburgh Silver Award (1990), including planning and executing several expeditions, in teams of six people.
<br>
Clean driving licence since 1989.
