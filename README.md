## Sources for my personal website, dcorney.com

Now hosted on Github

Locally, cd dc/website, then `jekyll serve` for local editing.

Do `jekyll build` to actually create site files before pushing to git. Push changes to a new branch, then can merge. Will appear at dcorney.com a few minutes later.

Slight bodge: pages with a date in the year 8888 appear only in an unlinked-to folder dcorney.com/ideas - the logic of this bodge is in _pages/08_blog.md

TODO: maybe try post.categories "contains" thought?
