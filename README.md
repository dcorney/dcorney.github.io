## Sources for my personal website, dcorney.com

Now hosted on Github

Locally, cd dc/website, then `jekyll serve`

Push changes to a new branch, then can merge. Will appear at dcorney.com a few minutes later.

Slight bodge: pages with a date in the year 8888 appear only in an unlinked-to folder dcorney.com/ideas


[Based on the tutorial](http://taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll)
