title: Accessing the ONS API
---

The ONS is great! We love the ONS! But to be honest, I struggled a bit with their API. Most of the blame lies with me: I don't use APIs as much as I ought to, so sometimes get my GETS confused with my POSTS. They do provide some documentation, but I couldn't find any examples in Python that I could copy and paste to get going. So I decided to create and share my own examples, to ease the path of anyone following.

So the UK's [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) publishes comprehensive statistics about the economy, population and society at national, regional and local levels. They also have an API, making some of their data available for directly incorporating in other tools and services. 

Their blog has a very nice essay on [how to access data](https://digitalblog.ons.gov.uk/2021/02/15/how-to-access-data-from-the-ons-beta-api/) using their API. There's also [their introduction and overview of the api](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/) for developers, which includes a few examples in JavaScript. 

And now there's my very basic repo on [how to access the ONS API via Python](https://github.com/dcorney/ons_api_demo). Download it and run the demo script and you'll see:
* a list of all available data sets;
* a list of all the "dimensions" that the UK Labour Market can be analysed along (age groups, seasonally-adjustmented or not, sex, etc.)
* the actual numbers ("observations") for a couple of time series.

And that's it. I might add more flexibility or features later on, but I hope as it stands, someone finds it useful. If so, I'd love to hear from you!
