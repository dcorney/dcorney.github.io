#### "Don't play the butter notes"

I recently stumbled across a [fascinating talk by Herbie Hancock](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkUNbe9sDpw). Apparently, back when he was playing in Miles Davis' sublime quintet, he got stuck in a rut: he felt he was always playing the same notes, the same patterns, expressing the same ideas. Then, mid-gig, Davis leaned over to him and said "Don't play the butter notes!" This obviously confused Hancock who eventually guessed that Davis meant "don't play the obvious, easy notes".

In the video, Hancock then gives a nice explanation of scales and the importance of the 3rd and 7th to really identify the scale. They define whether it's major or minor, blues or whatever. So in some ways, that makes them the obvious, easy notes. So Hancock experimented with... not playing them! Of course, he still had to express the music, play the tunes, fit in with the rest of the band and entertain the audience, but he could no longer do it the obvious way. So, being a musical genius, he came up with new ways of playing.

#### Constrained writing

This then reminded me of [Georges Perec's novel "A Void"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Void), notorious for being written without using the letter "e". Even writing one sentence without it is hard, let alone a 300-page novel (and a million bonus points for Gilbert Adair's translation). I'll try, but without promising that any output will contain insight only that it will contain only four non-consonant symbols.  Hard work but fun, possibly hard and thus fun. Anyway, lot's more examples can be found here: [wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constrained_writing).

#### Constrained problem solving

Sometimes, being **unconstrained** can be overwhelming: if you can go in any direction, how on earth do you choose one? Constraints can force you to explore avenues that might otherwise get overlooked, and so kick start something more creative. When  worked at [Signal](https://research.signal-ai.com/), it was a very small tech startup. Often, we discussed big ideas supported by a very open company culture. But we were also very constrained, with limited people, time and money. So we figured out what we *could* do, and did that (rather well, on the whole).

Now when faced with large open-ended problems (my favourite kind) instead of thinking "if only i had a roomful of data scientists and endless cloud credits, this would be easy!" I try and think: how would I solve this if I could only use pencil and paper? Or if I only had one day to finish? Or if I wanted to end my blog post on a really strong note?
