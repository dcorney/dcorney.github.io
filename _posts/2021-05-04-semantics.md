Some problems are easier to solve than others, which shouldn't be news to anyone.
But how much can we predict this in advance, and choose not to try and solve unsolvable problems?

Advances in NLP in recent years are genuinely exciting, but a few recent (and not so recent!) papers have reminded us to be cautious. 

Language can be analysed at multiple levels, e.g.:
phonology - basic set of sounds
morphology - unit of meaning, components of words
syntax - converting words into phrases and sentences
semantics - meaning
pragramtics - speech as acts
