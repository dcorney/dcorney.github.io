title: TIL - Oblique Strategies

(*I've decided to share more blog posts this year, with a focus on sharing "things I learned". These will be shorter (less rambling) then my other posts, but more frequent.*)

I first heard about [Oblique Strategies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies) a few years ago - a set of prompts designed to break mental blockages and help creativity, co-authored by Brian Eno. One such prompt I came across the other day said:

<font size="6">"Slow preparation, fast execution."</font>

And it struck me that my usual way of work is the opposite: some rapid exploration and prototyping followed by some slow polishing to make a final product. 

(If this is too vague to count as a TIL, I also recently learned that brandy butter goes very nicely on pancakes.)
