title: TIL - Live sewage information

Today I learned that Thames Water produce a nice data-driven [storm overflow map](https://www.thameswater.co.uk/edm-map), showing where sewage has (probably) been washed directly into local rivers and streams.

I don't tend to splash around in local streams, and the water I drink has been carefully treated (also by Thames Water) so I'm not directly affected by these overflows, but it's great that the data is published. They seem to have wired up their automatic sensors to their website. There's a similar [map for leaks](https://www.thameswater.co.uk/leak/).

It's also fun to click on the map to track the path of London's lesser-known rivers[^1]. How quickly can you find a sensor on the Wandle? The Roding? Or even the Unnamed Watercourse[^2]?
