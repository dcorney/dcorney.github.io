title: A Pythagorean Planter

---


Earlier in the summer, I was seeking inspiration for a new woodworking project. There were a few factors I weighed: I wanted to practice my dovetail joints; I had some old pine planks that my parents were chucking out; I thought I might make a planter to grow some fruit or veg in; and then I randomly came across a short video about of [Pythagoras's Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) - you know, the one about right-angle triangles. Something deep in my brain went "click" and here we are...

|After a few hiccups, the first box came out pretty well: close enough to 30cm on each side and pretty square. (The blue thing in the foreground is the dovetail jig I used).|<img src="/images/planter/DSC_6518_trim.jpg" alt="first box" width="400"/>|

|<img src="/images/planter/DSC_6522_trim.jpg" alt="two boxes" width="400"/>|Once I'd figured out what I was doing, the second box was straightforward - and 40cm square. <br>(The green thing on its side is the router I used to cut the dovetail joints - it's like a drill that goes sideways as well as up and down and is very loud...)|

|The last box was 50cm square and was getting to be (nearly) too big for my workbench and the dovetail jig. Here, the three boxes nest prettily inside each other.|<img src="/images/planter/DSC_6545_trim.jpg" alt="three boxes" width="400"/>|

|<img src="/images/planter/DSC_6823_trim.jpg" alt="raw triangle" width="400"/>|When I stepped outside and arranged the three squares on the ground just so, voila! A right-angle triangle appeared in the middle, in the space formed between the three boxes! There was much rejoicing, as my shonky woodwork had failed to disprove a millenia-old equation.|


Speaking of equations, a <b>brief</b> digression in some maths. Below on the left is a sketch of a right-angle triangle with sides <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>. What Pythagoras (or his theorem, anyway) shows is that the square of the hypotenuse (the longest side) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. So if you take any right-angle triangle and draw three squares, each with its edges as long as one edge of the triangle, then the area of the largest square is equal to the sum of the areas of the two smaller squares. Hence the famous equation: a&sup2; + b&sup2; = c&sup2;.

So stretching my graphics skillz to the limits along with my wood skillz, we get this:

A few bonus images of the finished planter. All that remains is to fill the three square parts to the same depth and see if the amount of soil in the two smaller boxes equals the amount of soil in the biggest one...

And for my next trick, I shall prove that [P = NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem) using some plywood and a hacksaw.
