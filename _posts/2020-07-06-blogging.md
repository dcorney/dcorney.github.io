title: More blogging


---

For about the 200th week in a row, I've recently thought about blogging more regularly, especially when I have Thoughts that I want to Express. The act of writing usually helps me clarify my own thoughts; any pleasure or value the reader acquires is a bonus. Assuming anyone even reads this. But watch this space! I intend to write more!
